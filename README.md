# Welcome

Welcome, traveler of the Internet! ❄️ You’ve just entered the **official GitHub Christmas Party Repository** — a magical place where code meets Christmas, pull requests meet panettone, and issues turn into digital fireplaces. 🔥💻

No virtualenv, no npm install, no docker-compose.  
Just pure, unfiltered holiday joy. 🎅✨

### 🎧 4. **Join the Virtual DJ-Set**

No Christmas party is complete without music — especially a **geek one**.

This repository hosts a **virtual DJ-set**, curated by developers, hackers, and elves from all over the world.  
Think of it as a shared playlist where **code meets rhythm** and the sleigh runs on beats instead of fuel.

📁 **DJ-Set Folder**  
All tracks, playlists, and references live here:

👉 [**`/dj-set/`**](https://github.com/openapi/xmas-party/tree/main/dj-set)  
(Feel free to browse, listen, and contribute!)

🎅 Santa’s rule:
> If it makes you want to code at 3 AM with hot cocoa and blinking LEDs, it belongs here.

Turn up the volume, fork the repo, and let the Christmas beats flow. 🔊✨

### 🎁 5. **Explore the Magical File: `SANTA.md`**
A lore-filled holiday letter explaining the philosophy of this party.
