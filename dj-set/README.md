# 🎧🎄 Openapi Xmas-Party 2025 Playlist 🎄🎧

> Welcome to the **Openapi Xmas-Party 2025 Playlist**!  

This is a **collaborative, coding-themed Christmas playlist** built by developers, techies, hackers, and festive elves 🧝‍♂️💻

Here, Christmas classics meet: APIs & SDKs, DevOps & CI/CD, Merge conflicts & pull requests, Sleepless nights… and hot cocoa ☕❄️

## 🎶 What is this?

This playlist is a joyful collection of **Christmas song parodies rewritten for developers**.

Each track:
- Takes a well-known Christmas song 🎄
- Rewrites the lyrics around **coding, APIs, Dev life, bugs, deployments, and open source**
- Keeps the holiday spirit alive… but with terminals, logs, and pipelines ✨

Think:
> *Silent Night*, but your build is finally green.  
> *Last Christmas*, but you gave them your PR.
