[CHORUS]
E        A      E      B7
Deploy bells ring, are you listening?
E        A      E      B7
In the cloud, code is glistening
A        E      F#m     B7
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
E        A      E      B7
Walking in a DevOps wonderland

[VERSE]
E
Gone away is the downtime
A        E
Here to stay, CI pipeline
F#m      B7
We push and we build
E        A
With scripts that are skilled
E        A      E      B7
Walking in a DevOps wonderland
