[CHORUS]
G        C      G      D
Jingle bells, API calls
G         C        G     D
Coding all the way
G         C        G      D
Oh what fun it is to write
G         D        G
A new endpoint today!

[VERSE]
G
Dashing through the code
C         G
In a repo full of bugs
D
Fixing as we go
C         G
With coffee in our mugs
G
Logs on every line
C         G
Tests that always fail
D
What fun it is to debug and ship
G         D        G
A feature for today!
