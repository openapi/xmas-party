[VERSE 1]
F#m                   
We're coding together
Bm                        E
 But still it's deploy
F#m
 And maybe we'll come back
Bm              E
 To prod, who can tell?
D                 E
 I guess there is no one to blame
A         E/G#      F#m   E
 We're pushing code (pushing code)
D                  C#sus4   C#
 Will APIs ever be the same again?

[CHORUS]
F#m          D        Bm        E
It's the final countdown...
F#m          D        Bm        E
The final countdown...

[VERSE 2]
F#m
 We're heading for launch (launch...)
Bm                 E
 And still we stand tall
F#m
 'Cause maybe they've seen us
Bm                E
 And welcomed our call, yeah
D            E
 With so many endpoints to go
A         E/G#      F#m   E
 And bugs to be found (to be found)
D                  C#sus4   C#
 I'm sure that we all miss the code...
```
It's the final countdown...
F#m          D        Bm        E
The final countdown...
